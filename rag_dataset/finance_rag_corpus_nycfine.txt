1. Purpose & Scope
This manual establishes the finance and accounting policies applicable to NYC Fine Jewelry (“the Company”), a small jewelry design and retail business. It governs the preparation of monthly actual and forecast financial statements covering the fiscal year 2025, beginning January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025. These policies align with US GAAP and are designed for timely management reporting, decision-making, and audit readiness.

2. Revenue Recognition Policy
• The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when control transfers to the customer, typically upon shipment (FOB shipping point) or in-store pickup.
• Revenue is measured net of returns, allowances, and sales taxes.
• Gift card breakage revenue is recognized when probability of redemption becomes remote, estimated at 24 months of inactivity.
• Cut-off: Shipments dispatched or picked up on or before the last calendar day of the month belong to that period’s revenue.

3. Inventory & Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
• Inventory valuation method: First-In, First-Out (FIFO).
• Inventory categories: Raw Materials, Work-in-Progress (WIP), Finished Goods.
• COGS includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead allocated on a standard-cost basis.
• Physical inventory counts are performed semi-annually (June & December).
• Obsolete/slow-moving stock provision: Write-down triggered when an item’s turnover exceeds 270 days.

4. Capital Expenditure & Depreciation
• Capitalization threshold: Assets > USD 2,000 with useful life ≥ 12 months are capitalized and depreciated. 
• Depreciation method: Straight-line.
• Useful lives:
- Computer & IT equipment: 3 years
- Display cases & leasehold improvements: 5 years
- Manufacturing equipment: 7 years
• Repairs & maintenance below the capex threshold are expensed as incurred.

5. Budgeting & Forecasting Guidelines
• Forecasts are updated quarterly; monthly phasing follows historical seasonality unless otherwise justified. 
• Variance trigger thresholds:
- Revenue: ±5% or ±USD 5,000 (whichever is higher)
- Gross Margin %: ±1.0 ppt
- Operating Expense (OPEX) lines: ±10% or ±USD 2,000
• Forecast versions are stored in the “Forecasts” schema of the finance database (table name pattern: forecast_YYYY_MM).

6. Variance Analysis & Management Commentary
• For each month-end close, the Controller must prepare and/or approve a variance report comparing Actual vs. Forecast for Income Statement lines.
• Variances exceeding the thresholds in Section 5 require a written explanation citing root cause, action plan, and expected timeline for resolution.
• The explanation should reference relevant policies (e.g., capitalization rules when depreciation shifts).
• The Variance Insight Assistant (RAG system) is authorized to query policy text to assist in drafting commentary.

7. Expense & Procurement Policy
• Purchase Orders (PO) are required for all supplier purchases > USD 1,000.
• Spending limits:
- CEO: up to USD 50,000 per PO
- Controller: up to USD 10,000 per PO
- Department Heads: up to USD 3,000 per PO
• Corporate credit card usage must be reconciled within 5 business days of statement close. 
• Travel & Entertainment (T&E;) per-diem: USD 75 domestic; USD 100 international.

8. Internal Controls & Compliance
• Segregation of duties: No individual may approve and pay a supplier invoice.
• Bank reconciliations performed monthly within 10 business days of month-end. 
• Quarterly review of user access to accounting systems.

9. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Company tracks the KPIs below each month. Formulas assume line‑items from the Income Statement and Balance Sheet tables contained in nycfine_FS.xlsx.

| KPI | Definition / Formula | Target |
|-----|----------------------|--------|

| **EBITDA** | Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization | Growth > 10 % YoY |
| **Inventory Turnover** | COGS ÷ Avg. Inventory | ≥ 4× annually |
| **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** | (AR ÷ Sales) × 30 | ≤ 30 days |
| **Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)** | (AP ÷ COGS) × 30 | ≥ 25 days |

10. Cash Management & Cash‑Flow Policy

• **Minimum Reserve** – Maintain a cash balance ≥ USD 75 000 (≈ 2 months fixed OPEX).  
• **Disbursement Schedule** – Supplier payments batched every Friday; emergency runs require CFO sign‑off.  
• **Short‑Term Investments** – Excess cash may be swept nightly into a high‑yield treasury fund; instruments must mature ≤ 90 days and be rated A‑1/P‑1.  
• **Borrowing Facility** – Revolving line of credit capped at USD 250 000; drawdowns limited to working‑capital gaps with repayment within 60 days.  
• **Variance Triggers** – If actual ending cash falls 10 % below forecast two weeks in a row, Controller must prepare a liquidity action plan.  
• **Segregation of Duties** – Treasury Analyst prepares forecasts; Controller reviews; CFO approves; CEO notified for draws > USD 100 000.
